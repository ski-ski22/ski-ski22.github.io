    <h1>What is the BEST Nintendo Switch Controller?</h1>

    <h4>*Disclaimer: This website is meant just so I can get boba when I turn this in for the Hackbotics club run by my friend Mr. Ronquillo (Nathan). I have little to no coding experience on this platform and that's why this website is a little ugly. I was told that if I finish this website, I will get free boba. I haven't had this drink in a long time and it is a treat that I get once in a while. Overall, enjoy this website because this will most likely be an amateur web design.</h4>

    <p>This is one of the worst controllers you can play with. Sometimes it's the only thing you can use in some games (e.g. Mario Party, 1-2 Switch). This controller is used mostly by the average player and is the controller that comes with the Nintendo Switch itself. There are many colors and designs for the simple controller, but each is prone to one thing: stick drift. Stick drift is when the joystick looks like it's centered, but the device reads that you're moving it in another direction (far left image) even when you're not touching the stick. Even with the attachments (two middle left images), it is not the optimal controller.</p>

    <p>A more comfortable controller, used by many. Though basic in its original design (first picture), it has many special edition colors and styles. It feels nice in the hands and has a professional touch to it. It has a great button layout and works well for many games on the Switch. It runs for 40 hours on a single charge. Great for any player or a pro gamer.</p>

    <p>This controller first appeared with the Nintendo GameCube Console in 2001. This controller on the Switch, however, is mostly used by pros (commonly with the game Super Smash Bros.) and people who enjoy/miss the feel of a GameCube controller. Personally, this controller is not for me. It takes time to adjust from another controller to this one. Overall not a bad controller, but not for me.</p>

    <p>Nintendo made controllers from the 1983 NES that can connect to the Switch. The classic controller (first and second images), like the SNES controller (third and fourth images), both have the extra "bumper" buttons on the top of the device so they can work on the Switch. This collection of controllers for the Switch was released in 2018. The button mapping on these controllers might confuse some gamers, but they are a solid choice for playing NES and SNES games on the Switch.</p>

    <h2>Nintendo 64 (N64) Controller:</h2>

    <p>The Nintendo 64 was released in 1967 and is the successor to the SNES controller. Its "M" designed shape makes it a little bit difficult to use, especially if you used a different controller before. Like the GameCube controller, it's not for me. It is mainly used by people who enjoy the feel of this old controller. Not recommended for new gamers.</p>

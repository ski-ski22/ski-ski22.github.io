    <h1>Joe-ski's Fun Facts</h1>
    <h4>Also by: Joseph I. Ruiz </h4>
    <h4>In the realm of sports, Joe is, in a sense, a Renaissance man, a jack of all trades if you will. Though he has his main sports (baseball, soccer, and swimming), he excels in others. With this knowledge of the infamous Joe-ski, you may think he's a master of all activities; the true embodiment of athleticism; an athletic demon. But, there comes a cost. When the world comes to another change of the seasons the power of the mighty Joe-ski almost resets. However, in some cases, there is little to no change at all. But the knowledge of the sport stays with him, growing the understanding of the exercise. But there is one season where the athlete peaks in strength, speed, power, and stamina: Autumn, also known as the “off-season.” He trains his body to the max and works in his facility called X-Fit Training. That or he sits and does nothing, which is what he did until 8th grade/freshman year of high school. The list below are the different sports that the all-mighty Joe-ski has played over the years along with the strengths and weaknesses of each sport.</h4>

    <p>Prone to Laughter: If you make him laugh during a sport, his performance level decreases tremendously due to being unfocused. Constant laughter during an activity will also lead to inconsistency and unpredictability.</p>
    
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Closing Statements By Yours Truly:</h2>
    <p>Hello people on the Internet, it’s Joe-ski. It is hard to play multiple sports because there is a lot of time when you aren’t practicing the same sport. For example, my main sports (baseball, soccer, swimming) are always hard to get back into the swing of things. The technique of the sport (e.g. mechanics of how to swing a bat, dribbling the ball, breathing properly), the strength in different areas of the body (e.g. exploding off the base, stamina, air capacity), and not to mention there’s a new schedule for every season for every sport. Muscle memory helps because I've done those movements many times, it's just hard to switch up everything so instantly. I might even have to relearn some things that I forgot while not playing a certain sport. Sometimes my sports overlap with one another. There are always a few weeks when I have to do baseball and swimming at the same time, and sometimes I have to pick which practice I’d rather go to. Even in the pre-season of a sport, baseball's pre-season overlaps with the soccer season. Not that this is too hard for me, but I make it work. During my off-season, starting 8th grade and freshman year, I usually spent my time in my gym (X-Fit Training in Pinole). My dad helped work with me to get my body in shape for the next round of sports for the year. Overall, I think that because I play all these sports, it makes me a well-rounded athlete. I also get to meet new people, work different muscle groups, and stay fit in every season. I don’t see many multi-sport athletes that much, because doing multiple things is what little kids used to do when their parents wanted them to try everything. I’m also not a one-trick pony and don’t specialize in one activity. I like everything I do: I coded a lot in middle school, I love to edit videos and make movies, I like to write like I’m doing now, and I love playing all these different sports. I can’t choose one that I like the best, but as a whole, the things that these activities have taught me shaped me into who I am today. What makes me even happier is that I get to teach these skills and lessons to others who haven't played the sport, or the younger generation of kids that will grow up to be even better than me. I love sports, and one day, I hope… That you will touch grass.</p>
    <p>For the love of God touch something green. Yours truly, </p>
    <p>Joe-ski</p>
